1. Build project with a command: mvn clean install
2. Now read about adding listeners in SoapUI 
3. create following directories : {project-directory}/ext {project-directory}/listeners 
4. run following copy commands cp -r {current-project}/listeners {project-directory}/listeners cp {current-project}/target/soapExt-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar {project-directory}/ext cp {current-project}/soapui-log4j.xml {project-directory} 
5. Done. :)
